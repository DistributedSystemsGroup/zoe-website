We just released version 2017.12 of Zoe, the most notable changes are:

 * New Docker Engine back-end, the Swarm back-end is now deprecated
 * Nodes and ZApps can be labelled for constraining execution placement, for example to run ZApps only on nodes with GPUs
 * Use non-reserved memory, cores, labels and image availability to take placement decisions
 * The elastic scheduler is considered stable, the simple scheduler is now deprecated
 * Zoe logs are more audit-friendly
 * Distinguish between reserved, allocated and in-use resources
 * Allocate cores automatically, respecting the minimum configured in the ZApp
 * Allow for more options and resource limits to be customized on the web interface (users or admins, not for guests), maximum limits are set in the zoe.conf file
 * Additional volumes can be mounted by specifying them in the zoe.conf file
 * Elastic services that die are rescheduled on a new node
 * Optional support for gathering usage metrics via KairosDB, for now these metrics are only used in the status page plots
 * More configuration options for LDAP authentication
