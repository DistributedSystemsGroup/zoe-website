We are using Zoe to drive the laboratory sessions of the new Algorithmic Machine Learning course at Eurecom. About 50 students interact with Jupyter notebooks and Spark clusters, learning the basis of data science with real-world use cases. All the course material is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsGroup/Algorithmic-Machine-Learning), feel free to have a look and contribute!
