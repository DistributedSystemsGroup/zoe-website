The Zoe team is proud to announce that spare CPU cycle on our internal platform are being donated to the [World Community Grid](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/) to help supporting research into important humanitarian causes. At the bottom of this page you can see the projects we are participating to and some statistics.
To run WCG software with Zoe, we created a [BOINC ZApp](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/zoe-apps/zapp-boinc). A script monitors the platform load and starts new BOINC ZApps via Zoe when the load is low.
