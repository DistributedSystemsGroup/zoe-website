## The project

Zoe was born in 2015 as a solution to the growing need in Eurecom to have a flexible and reproducible environment to do research on data intensive frameworks.
Virtual machines, managed via OpenStack, were cumbersome and users, once finished with their work, would not terminate them, wasting resources in our computing cluster.

Since then Zoe has grown a web interface and several enterprise-friendly features, like LDAP login. Several enterprises use Zoe in production and participate in development activities with bug reports and feature requests. Notable examples include Air France KLM and KPMG.

The project is released with an open source license. The source code is available in two repositories:

 * [Eurecom's GitLab](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/zoe): day-to-day development, use this to develop Zoe
 * [GitHub](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsGroup/zoe): code is published only when all tests are passed, use this to deploy Zoe
